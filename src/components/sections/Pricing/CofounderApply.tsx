 * CofounderApply — the deliberately under-invested 100vh tease.
 *
 * Cofounder is invite-only, by application. The marketing posture is to
 * make people curious, not to sell them. So this section is monolithic:
 * eyebrow, one short heading, one CTA. No subtitle. No benefit list. No
 * price. No seat count. The under-investment IS the design.
 *
 * If the user later wants a real `/apply/cofounder` route or a contact
 * form, swap the Link href for the route — the surrounding section
 * doesn't change.

          state (setIsTransitioningWipe) for non-anchor hrefs regardless of
          scheme. For mailto: that state never resets because no navigation
          actually happens, leaving the page in a wipe state. The plain anchor
          bypasses the handler entirely. */}
